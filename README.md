# Posting App 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.7.

This is an Angular application, with a basic node server set up. Users may add new Posts, and may send/receive data (posts with Title and Content) to/from the node server.

I developed this parallel to the course on MEAN Stack (https://hyland.udemy.com/course/angular-2-and-nodejs-the-practical-guide/) by <a href="https://academind.com/" target="_blank">Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller</a>

## To Run
Go to project folder and run the following:
1. ```npm install```
2. ```ng serve```
3. ```npm run start-server``` to start node server
